Analyzing 538 Star Wars Survey Data

While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?

The team needed to collect data addressing this question. To do this, they surveyed Star Wars fans using the online tool SurveyMonkey. They received 835 total responses.

For this project, I'll be cleaning and then analyzing the data.

When analyzing I'll be looking to find out the following:

Which movies have been seen by the highest number of people?
Which movies are considered the best/worst?
Which Characters are considered the best/worst?
